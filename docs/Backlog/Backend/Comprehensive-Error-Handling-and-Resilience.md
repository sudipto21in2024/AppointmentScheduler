# Gap Analysis: Comprehensive Error Handling and Resilience

## 1. Identified Gap

The High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) documents discuss asynchronous processing and mention "Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff" ([`docs/Architecture/LLD.mmd:220`]) within that context. However, there is a lack of a broader, comprehensive strategy for error handling and resilience across the entire microservices architecture, particularly for synchronous API calls and inter-service communication.

## 2. Impact

*   **System Fragility:** Without explicit resilience patterns (e.g., circuit breakers, bulkheads), a failure in one microservice can quickly cascade and bring down other dependent services, leading to a complete system outage.
*   **Poor User Experience:** Users may encounter cryptic error messages, timeouts, or unresponsive behavior when transient issues occur.
*   **Debugging Difficulty:** Tracing errors across multiple services without standardized error handling and logging can be extremely challenging and time-consuming.
*   **Operational Instability:** The system may struggle to recover gracefully from partial failures, leading to manual interventions and extended downtime.
*   **Inconsistent Error Responses:** Different services might return varied error formats, making client-side error handling complex and inconsistent.

## 3. Detailed Analysis

The current design acknowledges retry mechanisms for asynchronous operations, which is good. However, a microservices environment inherently introduces complexities with distributed transactions, network latency, and independent service failures. A robust system needs a strategy to handle these challenges for synchronous interactions as well.

Key areas where the current documentation is lacking:
*   **Synchronous Inter-Service Communication:** How are transient network failures, service unavailability, or timeouts handled when one service calls another synchronously?
*   **Client-Facing API Errors:** What is the standardized format for error responses returned to clients (frontend, third-party integrators)? How are different types of errors (validation, business logic, system) communicated?
*   **Circuit Breaker Implementation:** A critical pattern to prevent cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to a failing service.
*   **Bulkhead Pattern:** Isolating resources (e.g., thread pools) for different types of calls to prevent one failing component from consuming all resources.
*   **Timeout Configuration:** Explicit timeouts for all external and inter-service calls.
*   **Fallback Mechanisms:** What happens when a service is unavailable or returns an error? Can a degraded response be provided?
*   **Idempotency:** How are operations designed to be repeatable without causing unintended side effects, especially in the presence of retries?
*   **Centralized Error Logging and Monitoring:** While "Monitoring & Logging Service" is mentioned, the specific integration with error handling for capturing exceptions and application-level errors is not detailed.

## 4. Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive error handling and resilience strategy across the entire microservices architecture, documenting it thoroughly in both HLD and LLD.

### 4.1 High-Level Design Updates

*   Add a dedicated section on "Error Handling and Resilience" under "Architecture Style" or "System Components."
*   Introduce key resilience patterns:
    *   **Circuit Breaker:** Prevents repeated calls to failing services.
    *   **Retry Pattern:** For transient failures.
    *   **Timeout Pattern:** Defines maximum wait times for operations.
    *   **Bulkhead Pattern:** Isolates failing components.
    *   **Fallback Pattern:** Provides alternative responses during failures.
*   Define a standardized error response structure for client-facing APIs.
*   Emphasize centralized logging and alerting for errors.

### 4.2 Low-Level Design Updates

*   **Standardized Error Response Format:**
    *   Define a consistent JSON structure for API error responses (e.g., `code`, `message`, `details`, `traceId`).
    *   Implement global exception handling middleware in each microservice to catch unhandled exceptions and return standardized error responses.

*   **Inter-Service Communication Resilience:**
    *   **Polly Library (.NET):** Recommend and demonstrate the use of the Polly library for implementing circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts in HTTP client calls (e.g., using `HttpClientFactory`).
    *   **Timeouts:** Explicitly configure timeouts for all `HttpClient` instances used for inter-service communication.
    *   **Idempotency:** For critical write operations, ensure they are idempotent to safely handle retries.

*   **Circuit Breaker Implementation (using Polly):**
    *   For each critical external or inter-service dependency, define a circuit breaker policy.
    *   Monitor circuit state (closed, open, half-open) and configure appropriate thresholds for opening/closing.

*   **Bulkhead Pattern:**
    *   Consider using separate `HttpClient` instances or thread pools for different types of external calls to isolate failures.

*   **Fallback Mechanisms:**
    *   Implement fallback logic where appropriate, e.g., returning cached data or a default response if a non-critical service is unavailable.

*   **Centralized Logging and Monitoring Integration:**
    *   Ensure all exceptions are logged with relevant context (service name, request ID, user ID).
    *   Integrate with the Monitoring & Logging Service for error aggregation, alerting, and dashboard visualization.

### 5.2 Global Exception Handling Middleware (.NET Core)

```csharp
// shared/Middleware/ExceptionHandlingMiddleware.cs (New file)
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace shared.Middleware
{
    public class ExceptionHandlingMiddleware
    {
        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
        private readonly ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> _logger;

        public ExceptionHandlingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> logger)
        {
            _next = next;
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext httpContext)
        {
            try
            {
                await _next(httpContext);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "An unhandled exception occurred: {Message}", ex.Message);
                await HandleExceptionAsync(httpContext, ex);
            }
        }

        private static Task HandleExceptionAsync(HttpContext context, Exception exception)
        {
            context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
            context.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError;

            var errorResponse = new
            {
                traceId = context.TraceIdentifier,
                code = "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
                message = "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.",
                details = (object)null, // Potentially hide internal details in production
                timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow
            };

            // Custom error handling for specific exception types
            if (exception is ArgumentException || exception is InvalidOperationException)
            {
                context.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.BadRequest;
                errorResponse = new
                {
                    traceId = context.TraceIdentifier,
                    code = "BAD_REQUEST",
                    message = exception.Message,
                    details = (object)null,
                    timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow
                };
            }
            // Add more specific handlers as needed

            return context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(errorResponse));
        }
    }

    public static class ExceptionHandlingMiddlewareExtensions
    {
        public static IApplicationBuilder UseCustomExceptionHandling(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
        {
            return builder.UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>();
        }
    }
}
```

### 5.3 Polly Integration for `HttpClient` (.NET Core)

```csharp
// In each microservice's Program.cs or Startup.cs
using Polly;
using Polly.Extensions.Http;
using System.Net.Http;
using System;

// ... inside ConfigureServices method ...

// Define a retry policy
var retryPolicy = HttpPolicyExtensions
    .HandleTransientHttpError() // Handles 5xx and 408 responses
    .OrResult(msg => msg.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound) // Example: retry on 404
    .WaitAndRetryAsync(3, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, retryAttempt))); // Exponential backoff

// Define a circuit breaker policy
var circuitBreakerPolicy = HttpPolicyExtensions
    .HandleTransientHttpError()
    .CircuitBreakerAsync(
        handledEventsAllowedBeforeBreaking: 5, // Break after 5 failures
        durationOfBreak: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30) // Break for 30 seconds
    );

// Register HttpClient with policies
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("MyDownstreamService", client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://downstream-service-url/");
    client.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); // Global timeout for this client
})
.AddPolicyHandler(retryPolicy) // Apply retry policy
.AddPolicyHandler(circuitBreakerPolicy); // Apply circuit breaker policy

// Usage in a service:
// private readonly IHttpClientFactory _httpClientFactory;
// public MyService(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory) { _httpClientFactory = httpClientFactory; }
// var client = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient("MyDownstreamService");
// var response = await client.GetAsync("api/data");
```

### 5.4 Key Considerations

*   **Correlation IDs:** Implement correlation IDs to trace requests across multiple microservices for easier debugging. This can be done via HTTP headers and propagated through logs.
*   **Health Checks:** Use health check endpoints (e.g., `/health`) to monitor service availability and integrate with Kubernetes for readiness/liveness probes.
*   **Bulkhead Configuration:** Analyze critical dependencies and apply bulkhead patterns where necessary to protect against resource exhaustion.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test error handling and resilience scenarios, including fault injection.
