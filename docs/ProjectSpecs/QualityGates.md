- Monitoring systems operational
- Security and compliance requirements met

## Quality Gate Process

### 1. Gate Activation
- Each quality gate is activated at the beginning of its respective phase
- Gate criteria and deliverables are communicated to all stakeholders
- Timeline for gate completion is established

### 2. Gate Execution
- Activities are performed according to the defined criteria
- Deliverables are produced and reviewed
- Quality metrics are measured and recorded
- Issues are documented and tracked

### 3. Gate Review
- Quality gate committee reviews deliverables
- Criteria are evaluated against established standards
- Defects and issues are addressed
- Gate approval or rejection is determined

### 4. Gate Closure
- Approved gates are formally closed with documentation
- Rejected gates trigger corrective actions
- Lessons learned are captured for future improvements
- Next phase planning begins

## Quality Metrics and Measurements

### 1. Functional Quality Metrics
- Requirements coverage percentage
- Defect density per thousand lines of code
- Test case execution rate
- User story completion rate

### 2. Performance Quality Metrics
- System response time benchmarks
- Concurrent user capacity
- Database query performance
- API latency measurements

### 3. Security Quality Metrics
- Security vulnerability scan results
- Compliance check results
- Authentication and authorization effectiveness
- Data encryption compliance

### 4. Usability Quality Metrics
- User satisfaction scores
- Task completion rates
- Time to complete key workflows
- Error rate during user interactions

## Quality Assurance Activities
