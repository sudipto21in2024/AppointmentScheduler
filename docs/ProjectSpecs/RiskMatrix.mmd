# Risk Matrix: Multi-Tenant Appointment Booking System

## Overview
This document identifies, analyzes, and prioritizes risks associated with the Multi-Tenant Appointment Booking System project. The risk matrix categorizes risks by likelihood and impact to determine priority for mitigation strategies.

## Risk Identification Process
Risks were identified from the Business Requirements Document, Assumptions, and technical considerations. Risks are categorized into three main areas:
1. Technical Risks
2. Business Risks  
3. Operational Risks
