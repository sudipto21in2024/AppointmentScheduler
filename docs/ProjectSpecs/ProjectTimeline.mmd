## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Start Week | End Week | Key Focus |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Foundation | 8 weeks | Week 1 | Week 8 | Core architecture |
| Core Booking | 10 weeks | Week 9 | Week 18 | Booking workflow |
| Advanced Features | 8 weeks | Week 19 | Week 26 | Enhanced functionality |
| Production Ready | 6 weeks | Week 27 | Week 32 | Optimization & deployment |

## Critical Path Activities
1. Database schema design and implementation
2. Authentication and authorization system
3. Core microservices architecture
4. Payment processing integration
5. Performance optimization
6. Security implementation

## Dependencies
- Database schema must be completed before backend services
- Authentication service must be ready before other services
- Frontend components need to be developed before UI integration
- Payment gateway integration requires external API access
- Third-party service integrations require API access

## Risk Mitigation
- Buffer time allocated for unexpected delays
- Regular milestone reviews and adjustments
- Parallel development where possible
- Continuous integration to catch issues early
