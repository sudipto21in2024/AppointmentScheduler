# APM Server

This document explains how to configure APM Server and its usefulness.

## What is APM Server?

APM Server is an open-source application performance monitoring (APM) system that collects performance data from applications and provides insights into application performance and identifying bottlenecks. It is part of the Elastic Stack.

## Key Features

*   **Transaction Monitoring:** Tracks the performance of individual transactions, providing insights into response times, error rates, and other metrics.
*   **Service Maps:** Automatically discovers and visualizes the relationships between services, helping developers understand the architecture of their applications.
*   **Performance Baselines:** Establishes performance baselines for transactions and services, allowing developers to quickly identify anomalies.
*   **Error Tracking:** Collects and analyzes errors, providing developers with the information they need to troubleshoot and fix issues.

## Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the flow of data through the APM Server:

    D --> E(Kibana);
    E --> F(Developers);
```

## Implementing APM

1.  **Install APM Agent:** Install the APM agent in your application. The agent will automatically collect performance data and send it to the APM Server.
2.  **Configure APM Server:** Configure APM Server to connect to Elasticsearch.
3.  **Visualize data in Kibana:** Visualize the APM data in Kibana using the pre-built APM dashboards.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **No data is being collected:** Check the APM agent configuration for errors. Verify that the agent is running and that it is able to connect to the APM Server.
*   **Data is not being displayed in Kibana:** Check the APM Server configuration for errors. Verify that APM Server is connected to Elasticsearch and that the Kibana dashboards are configured correctly.
*   **Service maps are not being created:** Check the APM agent configuration for errors. Verify that the agent is able to discover the relationships between services.
