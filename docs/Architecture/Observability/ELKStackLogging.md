# ELK Stack Logging

This document explains how to use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for collecting, processing, and visualizing logs.

## What is the ELK Stack?

The ELK stack is a popular open-source logging and analytics platform that consists of the following components:

*   **Elasticsearch:** A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine that stores and indexes logs.
*   **Logstash:** A data processing pipeline that collects, transforms, and ships logs to Elasticsearch.
*   **Kibana:** A visualization and exploration tool that allows users to search, analyze, and visualize logs stored in Elasticsearch.

## Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the flow of data through the ELK stack:

    D --> E(Developers);
```

## Setting up ELK Stack Logging

1.  **Install the ELK stack:** Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana on your servers.
2.  **Configure Logstash:** Configure Logstash to collect logs from your applications. This may involve specifying the log file paths, input formats, and output destinations.
3.  **Configure Elasticsearch:** Configure Elasticsearch to store and index the logs.
4.  **Configure Kibana:** Configure Kibana to connect to Elasticsearch and visualize the logs.

## Logstash Configuration Example

```
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/myapp.log"
    start_position => "beginning"
  }
}

filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}" }
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "myapp-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Logs are not being collected:** Check the Logstash configuration for errors. Verify that the log file paths are correct and that Logstash has the necessary permissions to read the log files.
*   **Logs are not being indexed:** Check the Elasticsearch configuration for errors. Verify that Elasticsearch is running and that Logstash is able to connect to Elasticsearch.
*   **Logs are not being displayed in Kibana:** Check the Kibana configuration for errors. Verify that Kibana is connected to Elasticsearch and that the index patterns are configured correctly.
