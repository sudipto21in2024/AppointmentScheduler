# High-Level System Design: Multi-Tenant Appointment Booking System

## 1. System Overview

The Multi-Tenant Appointment Booking System is a SaaS platform designed to enable service providers to list services with configurable time slots and pricing, while allowing customers to search, book, and manage appointments seamlessly.

## 2. Architecture Style

The system follows a **Microservices Architecture** pattern with the following key characteristics:
- **Event-Driven**: Uses event sourcing for audit trails and system reconstruction
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separates command and query sides for optimal performance
- **Multi-Tenant**: Supports multiple service providers with isolated data and configurations
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle growth from hundreds to thousands of service providers and millions of appointments

## 3. System Components

### 3.1 Core Services

#### User Service
- Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization
- Handles user profiles, roles, and permissions
- Implements tenant isolation for multi-tenancy

#### Booking Service
- Manages appointment booking workflow
- Handles slot availability and conflicts
- Processes booking requests and approvals

#### Service Management Service
- Enables service providers to create and manage services
- Handles service configurations and pricing
- Manages service categories and descriptions

#### Payment Service
- Processes payment transactions
- Integrates with external payment gateways
- Manages billing and subscription plans

#### Notification Service
- Sends automated notifications for bookings, cancellations, and reminders
- Supports email, SMS, and push notification channels
- Handles notification templates and preferences

#### Reporting Service
- Generates analytics and business intelligence reports
- Provides dashboard views for service providers
- Offers booking statistics and performance metrics

#### Configuration Service
- Manages system-wide configurations
- Handles dynamic settings and feature toggles
- Stores tenant-specific configurations

### 3.2 Supporting Services

#### Authentication & Authorization Service
- Implements JWT-based authentication
- Manages OAuth2 flows for external integrations
- Provides role-based access control (RBAC)

#### Cache Service
- Implements Redis caching for session management
- Caches frequently accessed data to improve performance
- Manages cache invalidation strategies

#### Search Service
- Implements Elasticsearch for advanced service search capabilities
- Provides real-time search and filtering
- Supports faceted search and autocomplete

#### Monitoring & Logging Service
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Alerting and incident management

## 4. Data Flow Overview

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate through the Authentication Service
2. **Service Discovery**: Customers search and browse services via Search Service
3. **Booking Process**: Booking workflow managed by Booking Service with validations
4. **Payment Processing**: Payments handled by Payment Service with external gateway integration
5. **Notifications**: Automated notifications sent via Notification Service
6. **Data Persistence**: All data stored in SQL Server with event sourcing
7. **Reporting**: Analytics generated by Reporting Service from event streams

## 5. Integration Points

### 5.1 External Integrations
- Payment Gateway API (Stripe/PayPal)
- SMS Notification Service
- Email Service Providers
- Analytics Platforms

### 5.2 Internal Services
- Cross-service communication via message queues
- Shared event store for audit trails
- Centralized configuration management

## 6. Technology Stack

### 6.1 Backend
- .NET Core 8+ for microservices
- C# as primary language
- Entity Framework Core for ORM
- MediatR for command/query handling
- Redis for caching
- SQL Server for primary data storage

### 6.2 Frontend
- Angular 17+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- PWA capabilities for mobile access

### 6.3 Infrastructure
- Azure Cloud Platform
- Docker containers for service deployment
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Elasticsearch for search capabilities

## 7. Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- GDPR compliance for data protection

## 8. Scalability & Performance

- Horizontal scaling of microservices
- Read replicas for database optimization
- CDN for static assets
- Caching strategies for improved response times
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations

## 9. Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed in a cloud-native environment with:
- Multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Auto-scaling based on load metrics
