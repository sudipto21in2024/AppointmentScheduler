3. Payment Service processes payment if required
4. Booking Service creates booking record
5. Notification Service sends confirmation
6. Event is published to event store for audit trail
7. Reporting Service updates analytics

### 2.2 Service Creation Flow
1. Service provider creates service via frontend
2. Service Management Service validates service data
3. Service Repository stores service definition
4. Search Service indexes service for discoverability
5. Event is published to event store
6. Configuration Service updates tenant settings

### 2.3 Payment Processing Flow
1. Customer selects payment method
2. Payment Service validates payment details
3. Payment Gateway Adapter communicates with external provider
4. Transaction processed and confirmed
5. Payment Repository stores transaction details
6. Notification Service sends payment confirmation

## 3. Data Models and Relationships

### 3.1 Core Data Entities
- **User**: Customer and service provider accounts
- **Tenant**: Isolated environment for service providers
- **Service**: Service offerings with configurations
- **Slot**: Available time slots for service bookings
- **Booking**: Appointment reservations
- **Payment**: Transaction records and billing
- **Notification**: Communication history
- **Report**: Analytics and business intelligence data

### 3.2 Entity Relationships
- One-to-Many: Tenant → Services, Services → Slots, Users → Bookings
- Many-to-Many: Users ↔ Services (for provider relationships)
- One-to-One: Booking ↔ Payment
- One-to-Many: Service → Reviews, Users → Reviews

## 4. API Design Patterns

### 4.1 RESTful API Endpoints
- Standard CRUD operations for all entities
- Resource-based URL structure
- Consistent HTTP status codes
- JSON-based request/response format

### 4.2 Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Separate APIs for command (write) and query (read) operations
- Optimized data models for each purpose
- Event-driven updates for consistency

### 4.3 Event Sourcing Implementation
- All state changes are stored as events
- Event store serves as the single source of truth
- Events can be replayed for system reconstruction

## 5. Communication Patterns

### 5.1 Synchronous Communication
- REST API calls between services
- Direct database queries within service boundaries
- GraphQL for complex data retrieval needs

### 5.2 Asynchronous Communication
