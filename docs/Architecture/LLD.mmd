## 2. Data Flow Details

### 2.1 Booking Creation Flow
1. Customer initiates booking request via frontend
2. Booking Service validates slot availability
3. Payment Service processes payment if required
4. Booking Service creates booking record
5. Notification Service publishes `TemplateNotificationEvent` (containing template name and data)
6. Notification Service's `TemplateNotificationConsumer` processes the event, renders the template using the Template Engine, and enqueues the notification for dispatch via Hangfire.
6. Event is published to event store for audit trail
7. Reporting Service updates analytics

### 2.2 Service Creation Flow
1. Service provider creates service via frontend
2. Service Management Service validates service data
3. Service Repository stores service definition
4. Search Service indexes service for discoverability
5. Event is published to event store
6. Configuration Service updates tenant settings

### 2.3 Payment Processing Flow
1. Customer selects payment method
2. Payment Service validates payment details
3. Payment Gateway Adapter communicates with external provider
4. Transaction processed and confirmed
5. Payment Repository stores transaction details
6. Notification Service publishes `TemplateNotificationEvent` for payment confirmation (contains template name and data)
7. Notification Service's `TemplateNotificationConsumer` processes the event, renders the template, and enqueues the notification for dispatch via Hangfire.

## 3. Data Models and Relationships

### 3.1 Core Data Entities
- **User**: Customer and service provider accounts
- **Tenant**: Isolated environment for service providers
- **Service**: Service offerings with configurations
- **Slot**: Available time slots for service bookings
- **Booking**: Appointment reservations
- **Payment**: Transaction records and billing
- **Notification**: Communication history
- **Report**: Analytics and business intelligence data

### 3.2 Entity Relationships
- One-to-Many: Tenant → Services, Services → Slots, Users → Bookings
- Many-to-Many: Users ↔ Services (for provider relationships)
- One-to-One: Booking ↔ Payment
- One-to-Many: Service → Reviews, Users → Reviews

## 4. API Design Patterns
