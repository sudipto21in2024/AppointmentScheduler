# Backend Metrics Scenarios

This document outlines various scenarios where different metrics can be helpful for backend observability in ASP.NET Core APIs.

## General System Health

*   **CPU Utilization:** High CPU utilization can indicate a bottleneck in the system.
    *   **Scenario:** Spike in CPU utilization during peak hours.
    *   **Action:** Investigate slow queries, inefficient code, or resource exhaustion.
*   **Memory Utilization:** High memory utilization can lead to performance degradation and crashes.
    *   **Scenario:** Memory leak causing gradual increase in memory usage.
    *   **Action:** Identify the source of the memory leak and fix the code.
*   **Disk I/O:** High disk I/O can indicate slow disk performance or excessive disk activity.
    *   **Scenario:** Slow response times for database queries due to disk I/O bottlenecks.
    *   **Action:** Optimize database queries, upgrade storage, or implement caching.
*   **Network I/O:** High network I/O can indicate network congestion or excessive data transfer.
    *   **Scenario:** Slow API response times due to network latency.
    *   **Action:** Optimize network configuration, reduce data transfer size, or use a CDN.

## API Performance

*   **Request Rate:** Tracks the number of requests per second.
    *   **Scenario:** Sudden drop in request rate indicating a service outage.
    *   **Action:** Investigate the cause of the service outage and restore service availability.
*   **Response Time:** Measures the time it takes to process a request.
    *   **Scenario:** Increased response time for a specific API endpoint.
    *   **Action:** Profile the code, identify slow queries, or optimize caching.
*   **Error Rate:** Tracks the number of errors per second.
    *   **Scenario:** Increased error rate for a specific API endpoint.
    *   **Action:** Investigate the cause of the errors and fix the code.
*   **Database Query Time:** Measures the time it takes to execute database queries.
    *   **Scenario:** Slow database queries causing slow API response times.
    *   **Action:** Optimize database queries, add indexes, or upgrade the database server.

## Business Logic

*   **Orders Processed:** Tracks the number of orders processed successfully.
    *   **Scenario:** Sudden drop in orders processed indicating a problem with the ordering system.
    *   **Action:** Investigate the cause of the problem and restore the ordering system.
*   **Users Registered:** Tracks the number of new users registered.
    *   **Scenario:** Decline in user registrations indicating a problem with the registration process.
    *   **Action:** Investigate the cause of the decline and improve the registration process.
*   **Payments Processed:** Tracks the number of payments processed successfully.
    *   **Scenario:** Increase in payment failures indicating a problem with the payment gateway.
    *   **Action:** Investigate the cause of the payment failures and contact the payment gateway provider.

## Cache Performance

*   **Cache Hit Rate:** Measures the percentage of requests that are served from the cache.
    *   **Scenario:** Low cache hit rate indicating inefficient caching.
    *   **Action:** Increase cache size, optimize cache keys, or use a more efficient caching algorithm.
*   **Cache Eviction Rate:** Tracks the number of items evicted from the cache.
    *   **Scenario:** High cache eviction rate indicating that the cache is too small or that the eviction policy is not optimal.
    *   **Action:** Increase cache size, optimize cache eviction policy, or use a distributed cache.

## SQL Performance

*   **SQL Query Time:** Measures the time it takes to execute SQL queries.
    *   **Scenario:** Slow SQL queries causing slow API response times.
    *   **Action:** Optimize SQL queries, add indexes, or use query caching.
*   **SQL Connection Pool Utilization:** Tracks the number of active and idle connections in the SQL connection pool.
    *   **Scenario:** High connection pool utilization indicating a bottleneck in the database connection.
    *   **Action:** Increase the maximum pool size, optimize connection management, or use connection pooling.

By monitoring these metrics, developers can gain valuable insights into the performance and health of their backend APIs and quickly identify and resolve issues.
