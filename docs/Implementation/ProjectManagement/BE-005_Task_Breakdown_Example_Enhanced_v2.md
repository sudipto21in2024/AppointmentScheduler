# BE-005 Task Breakdown Example (Enhanced v2)

This document demonstrates how the enhanced Project Manager AI Agent would break down the BE-005 task ("Implement Core Booking and Appointment Business Logic") into granular subtasks with detailed implementation guidance, task naming conventions, and completion tracking.

## Project Overview

### Analyzed Documents
1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)
2. Database Schema (Entities)
3. API Specifications (OpenAPI)
4. Existing Implementation Analysis

### Identified Gaps
1. Missing service layer implementation
2. Incomplete validation logic
3. Limited error handling
4. No comprehensive testing strategy
5. Incomplete event-driven workflows

### High-Level Task Categories
1. Service Layer Implementation
2. Validation and Error Handling
3. Event-Driven Workflow Implementation
4. Testing Implementation
5. Documentation and Quality Assurance

## Task Naming Convention

- **Main Task**: `BE-005_implement_booking_business_logic`
- **Subtasks**: `BE-005-01_create_booking_service_interface`, `BE-005-02_implement_booking_service`, etc.
- **Implementation Guidance Documents**: `BE-005_booking_service_implementation_guidance.md`

## Task Dependencies and Sequencing

### Critical Path
1. BE-005-01 → BE-005-02 (Booking Service Implementation)
2. BE-005-03 → BE-005-04 (Slot Service Implementation)
3. BE-005-05 → BE-005-06 (Booking Validator Implementation)
4. BE-005-02 → BE-005-07 (Booking consumer enhancement)
5. BE-005-08 (Independent creation)

### Parallel Tasks
- BE-005-01 and BE-005-03 and BE-005-05 (Interface creation)
- BE-005-02 and BE-005-04 and BE-05-06 (Service and validator implementation)
- BE-005-07 and BE-005-08 (Consumer implementation)

### Blocking Relationships
- BE-005-02 blocks BE-005-07 (Booking service needed for consumer)
- BE-005-01, BE-005-02 block testing tasks
- Implementation guidance documents support all implementation tasks

- Testing implementation (2 days)

Total estimated effort: 10 days (80 hours) for core backend team

## Completion Verification

### Main Task Completion Criteria
The BE-005 task will be marked as complete when:
1. All required subtasks (BE-005-01 through BE-005-08) are marked as COMPLETED
2. All required deliverables have been created and verified
3. All acceptance criteria have been met and verified through testing
4. Implementation guidance documents have been created
5. Code has been reviewed and approved
6. All tests (unit, integration, e2e) are passing

### Subtask Completion Verification
Each subtask will be marked as complete when:
1. All acceptance criteria have been met
2. Code has been implemented according to implementation guidance
3. Required files have been created/modified
4. Unit tests have been written and are passing
5. Code has been reviewed and approved
6. Task status is updated to COMPLETED with completion date

This enhanced task breakdown demonstrates how the Project Manager AI Agent would decompose the BE-005 task into granular, manageable subtasks with detailed implementation guidance, proper naming conventions, and comprehensive completion tracking to ensure the main task can be properly marked as complete when all subtasks are finished.
