# BE-005 Task Breakdown Example

This document demonstrates how the Project Manager AI Agent would break down the BE-005 task ("Implement Core Booking and Appointment Business Logic") into granular subtasks following the defined process.

## Project Overview

### Analyzed Documents
1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)
2. Database Schema (Entities)
3. API Specifications (OpenAPI)
4. Existing Implementation Analysis

### Identified Gaps
1. Missing service layer implementation
2. Incomplete validation logic
3. Limited error handling
4. No comprehensive testing strategy
5. Incomplete event-driven workflows

### High-Level Task Categories
1. Service Layer Implementation
2. Validation and Error Handling
3. Event-Driven Workflow Implementation
4. Testing Implementation
5. Documentation and Quality Assurance

## Granular Task Breakdown

### 1. Service Layer Implementation

## Task Dependencies and Sequencing

### Critical Path
1. BE-005-01 → BE-005-02 (Booking Service Implementation)
2. BE-005-03 → BE-005-04 (Slot Service Implementation)
3. BE-005-05 → BE-005-06 (Booking Validator Implementation)
4. BE-005-02 → BE-005-09 (Booking Service Unit Tests)
5. BE-005-01, BE-005-02 → BE-005-10 (Booking API Integration Tests)

### Parallel Tasks
- BE-005-01 and BE-005-03 (Interface creation)
- BE-005-05 and BE-005-08 (Validator interface and Payment consumer)
- BE-005-09 and BE-005-10 (Unit and integration tests)

### Blocking Relationships
- BE-005-02 blocks BE-005-07 (Booking service needed for consumer)
- BE-005-08 blocks BE-005-07 (Payment consumer needed for workflow)
- BE-005-01, BE-005-02 block BE-005-10 (API implementation needed for tests)

## Resource Allocation

### Skill Requirements Mapping
- **C#, ASP.NET Core**: All backend tasks
- **Entity Framework Core**: BE-005-02, BE-005-04
- **MassTransit**: BE-005-07, BE-005-08
- **FluentValidation**: BE-005-05, BE-005-06
- **Unit Testing (xUnit, Moq)**: BE-005-09
- **Integration Testing**: BE-005-10

### Team Assignment
- **Backend Team**: BE-005-01 through BE-005-08
- **QA Team**: BE-005-09, BE-005-10

## Timeline Estimate

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- BE-005-01, BE-005-03, BE-005-05 (3 days)
- BE-005-02, BE-005-04, BE-005-06 (4 days)

### Phase 2: Event Processing (Week 2)
- BE-005-08 (2 days)
- BE-005-07 (3 days)

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 3)
- BE-005-09, BE-005-10 (5 days)

Total estimated effort: 12 days (96 hours) for core backend team

This task breakdown demonstrates how the Project Manager AI Agent would decompose the BE-005 task into granular, manageable subtasks with clear dependencies, acceptance criteria, and resource allocation.
