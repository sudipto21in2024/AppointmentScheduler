### 1. Dashboard API provides real-time booking and revenue data
- **Evidence**: `backend/services/ReportingService/Controllers/DashboardController.cs`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/dashboard/overview`
- **Implementation**: `DashboardService.GetOverviewDataAsync` method in `backend/services/ReportingService/Services/DashboardService.cs`

### 2. Analytics API aggregates data by time periods
- **Evidence**: `backend/services/ReportingService/Controllers/AnalyticsController.cs`
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /api/analytics/bookings`
  - `GET /api/analytics/revenue`
- **Implementation**: 
  - `AnalyticsService.GetBookingDataAsync` method in `backend/services/ReportingService/Services/AnalyticsService.cs`
  - `AnalyticsService.GetRevenueDataAsync` method in `backend/services/ReportingService/Services/AnalyticsService.cs`

### 3. Customer insights API provides booking history and feedback
- **Evidence**: `backend/services/ReportingService/Controllers/AnalyticsController.cs`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/analytics/customers`
- **Implementation**: `AnalyticsService.GetCustomerDataAsync` method in `backend/services/ReportingService/Services/AnalyticsService.cs`

### 4. System health API monitors performance and errors
- **Evidence**: `backend/services/ReportingService/Controllers/DashboardController.cs`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/dashboard/health`
- **Implementation**: `DashboardService.GetSystemHealthAsync` method in `backend/services/ReportingService/Services/DashboardService.cs`

### 5. All APIs support filtering and sorting
- **Evidence**: 
  - `shared/DTOs/AnalyticsFilterDto.cs`
  - `shared/DTOs/DashboardFilterDto.cs`
  - `shared/Validators/AnalyticsValidator.cs`
- **Implementation**: Filter parameters are accepted by all controller methods and validated before processing

### 6. Data is properly secured by tenant isolation
- **Evidence**: All service methods require tenantId parameter and filter data accordingly
- **Implementation**: All database queries include tenantId filtering
