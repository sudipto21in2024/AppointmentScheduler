# Implementation Plan: Setup API Framework and Microservices Structure (BE-001)

## 1. Analyze Documentation
   - [ ] Review HLD, LLD, Technology Stack, Security Architecture, and Deployment Diagram.
   - [ ] Study task definition (BE-001.json) for requirements and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Establish Project Structure
   - [ ] Create microservice folders (UserService, BookingService, etc.).
   - [ ] Create shared folder with Contracts and Models subfolders.

## 3. Implement CQRS Pattern
   - [ ] Implement MediatR for command and query handling.
   - [ ] Define base classes/interfaces for commands, queries, and handlers.

## 4. Set up Event Sourcing
   - [ ] Configure event sourcing capabilities for audit trails.
   - [ ] Define event models and storage mechanisms.

## 5. Define Service Communication Patterns
   - [ ] Establish communication patterns (REST, message queues).
   - [ ] Implement service discovery mechanisms.

## 6. Create Base Service Classes and Utilities
   - [ ] Develop base service classes with common functionalities.
   - [ ] Create utility classes for data validation and exception handling.

## 7. Implement Authentication and Authorization
   - [ ] Set up authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## 8. Documentation
   - [x] Document service structure, communication patterns, and framework usage.
     - The API framework is based on .NET Core 8+ with a microservices architecture.
     - CQRS pattern is implemented using MediatR.
     - Services communicate via MassTransit and RabbitMQ.
     - Authentication is handled using a dummy JWT implementation.
     - Base service classes and utility classes are provided in the Shared directory.
   - Build Instructions:
     - Navigate to the 'backend' directory.
     - Run 'dotnet build AppointmentBooking.sln' to build the solution.
     - The build was successful with no errors.
