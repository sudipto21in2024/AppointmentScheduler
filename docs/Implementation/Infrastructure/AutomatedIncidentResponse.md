# Automated Incident Response

This document describes the implementation of automated incident response for all microservices.

## Configuration

For each microservice:

1.  **AlertManager Configuration:**
    *   Configure AlertManager to send notifications to an automation system (e.g., webhook) when a "Service Unavailable" alert is triggered.
    *   The notification should include relevant information about the incident, such as the service name, severity, and timestamp.

2.  **Automation Script:**
    *   Create a script that receives the AlertManager notification and executes the appropriate "Service Unavailable" runbook.
    *   The script should:
        *   Parse the AlertManager notification.
        *   Identify the affected service.
        *   Attempt to restart the service.
        *   Log the incident and the actions taken.
        *   Send a notification to the on-call engineer if the service fails to restart.

## Testing

For each microservice:

1.  **Simulate Incident:**
    *   Simulate a service unavailability incident by stopping the service or causing it to crash.

2.  **Verify Automation:**
    *   Verify that AlertManager sends a notification to the automation system.
    *   Verify that the automation script is executed.
    *   Verify that the service is automatically restarted.
    *   Verify that the incident is logged.
    *   Verify that a notification is sent to the on-call engineer if the service fails to restart.

## Self-Healing Mechanisms

For each microservice:

1.  **Docker Restart Policy:**
    *   Configure the Docker container to automatically restart if it fails.
    *   This can be done by adding the `restart: always` option to the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2.  **Health Checks:**
    *   Implement health checks to monitor its health.
    *   The health check should verify that the service is running and responsive.
    *   If the health check fails, the service should be automatically restarted.
