# Database Backup and Recovery Procedures

## Backup Strategy

*   Full backups should be performed daily.
*   Differential backups should be performed hourly.
*   Transaction log backups should be performed every 15 minutes.

## Recovery Procedures

*   In case of data loss, restore the latest full backup, followed by the latest differential backup, and then all transaction log backups since the differential backup.

## Testing

*   Regularly test the backup and recovery procedures to ensure they are working correctly.
