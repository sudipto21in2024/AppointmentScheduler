# Execution Plan: Implement Backup and Disaster Recovery for Observability (INF-005-J)

## Task Description

Implement backup and disaster recovery for the observability stack to ensure that it is available even in the event of a disaster.

## Business Rules

*   Backup strategies must be implemented.
*   Recovery procedures must be created.
*   High availability setup must be implemented.
*   Failover mechanisms must be implemented.

## Steps

1.  **Define Backup Strategies:**
    *   Identify the components of the observability stack that require backup (Prometheus data, Grafana dashboards, Elasticsearch data, AlertManager configuration, etc.).
    *   Determine the appropriate backup frequency and retention period for each component.
    *   Choose a backup method (e.g., snapshots, file-based backups) and storage location (e.g., cloud storage, network share).
2.  **Create Recovery Procedures:**
    *   Document the steps required to restore each component from a backup.
    *   Test the recovery procedures regularly to ensure they are working correctly.
3.  **Implement High Availability:**
    *   Set up redundant instances of critical components (Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, AlertManager) to ensure that the observability stack remains available even if one instance fails.
    *   Use a load balancer to distribute traffic between the redundant instances.
4.  **Implement Failover Mechanisms:**
    *   Configure automatic failover to a secondary site in the event of a disaster at the primary site.
    *   Test the failover mechanisms regularly to ensure they are working correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Backup strategies are implemented.
*   Recovery procedures are created.
*   High availability setup is implemented.
*   Failover mechanisms are implemented.

## Checkpoints for Resuming Execution

Once the DNS resolution issue is resolved, the following checkpoints can be used to resume the execution of the plan:

1.  **Define Backup Strategies:**
    *   **Checkpoint:** After starting the Docker containers, implement the following backup strategies:
        *   **SQL Server:** Daily full backups, hourly differential backups, and transaction log backups every 15 minutes using SQL Server's built-in backup and restore tools. Store backups in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
        *   **Prometheus:** Daily snapshots of the `prometheus_data` volume. Store snapshots in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
        *   **Grafana:** Daily backups of the `grafana_data` volume. Store backups in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
        *   **Elasticsearch:** Daily snapshots using Elasticsearch's snapshot API. Store snapshots in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
        *   **AlertManager:** Hourly backups of the `alertmanager.yml` file. Store backups in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
        *   **Logstash:** Hourly backups of the `logstash.conf` file. Store backups in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
        *   **OTel Collector:** Hourly backups of the `otel-collector-config.yml` file. Store backups in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
2.  **Create Recovery Procedures:**
     *   Document the steps required to restore each component from a backup.
     *   Test the recovery procedures regularly to ensure they are working correctly.
3.  **Implement High Availability:**
     *   Set up redundant instances of critical components (Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, AlertManager) to ensure that the observability stack remains available even if one instance fails.
     *   Use a load balancer to distribute traffic between the redundant instances.
4.  **Implement Failover Mechanisms:**
     *   Configure automatic failover to a secondary site in the event of a disaster at the primary site.
     *   Test the failover mechanisms regularly to ensure they are working correctly.

**Note:** Execution of this plan is currently blocked due to a DNS resolution error preventing the Docker containers from starting. Please resolve the DNS issue before proceeding.
