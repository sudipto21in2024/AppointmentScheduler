# Runbook: High Memory Usage

## Incident Type: High Memory Usage

## Description:
This runbook provides steps to resolve a high memory usage incident on a server or service.

## Symptoms:
*   Monitoring alerts indicate high memory usage.
*   Slow service performance.
*   Users experience delays or timeouts.
*   System crashes or instability.

## Impact:
*   Service degradation or unavailability.
*   Increased resource consumption.
*   Potential data loss.

## Prerequisites:
*   Access to the server or service infrastructure.
*   Credentials for relevant monitoring tools.

## Procedure:
1.  Identify the process or service consuming the most memory resources using monitoring tools.
2.  Analyze the process's activity to determine the cause of the high memory usage, such as memory leaks or excessive caching.
3.  If the process is non-essential, stop or terminate it.
4.  If the process is essential, attempt to optimize its configuration or code to reduce memory usage.
5.  Consider scaling up the server or service if the high memory usage is due to increased demand.
6.  Escalate to the appropriate team if the issue cannot be resolved.

## Rollback Plan:
*   If stopping or terminating a process causes further issues, restart it.
*   If configuration changes cause instability, revert to the previous stable configuration.

## Escalation:
*   If high memory usage persists for more than 15 minutes, escalate to the on-call engineer.

## Automation Potential:
*   Automated process monitoring and restart.
