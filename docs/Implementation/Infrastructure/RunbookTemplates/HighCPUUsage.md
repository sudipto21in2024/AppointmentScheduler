# Runbook: High CPU Usage

## Incident Type: High CPU Usage

## Description:
This runbook provides steps to resolve a high CPU usage incident on a server or service.

## Symptoms:
*   Monitoring alerts indicate high CPU usage.
*   Slow service performance.
*   Users experience delays or timeouts.

## Impact:
*   Service degradation or unavailability.
*   Increased resource consumption.

## Prerequisites:
*   Access to the server or service infrastructure.
*   Credentials for relevant monitoring tools.

## Procedure:
1.  Identify the process or service consuming the most CPU resources using monitoring tools.
2.  Analyze the process's activity to determine the cause of the high CPU usage.
3.  If the process is non-essential, stop or terminate it.
4.  If the process is essential, attempt to optimize its configuration or code to reduce CPU usage.
5.  Consider scaling up the server or service if the high CPU usage is due to increased demand.
6.  Escalate to the appropriate team if the issue cannot be resolved.

## Rollback Plan:
*   If stopping or terminating a process causes further issues, restart it.
*   If configuration changes cause instability, revert to the previous stable configuration.

## Escalation:
*   If high CPU usage persists for more than 15 minutes, escalate to the on-call engineer.

## Automation Potential:
*   Automated process monitoring and restart.
