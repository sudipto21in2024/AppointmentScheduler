# Execution Plan: Optimize Observability Stack Performance (INF-005-I)

## Task Description

Optimize the performance of the observability stack to ensure it can handle the load and provide accurate data.

## Business Rules

*   Resource optimization must be performed.
*   Data retention tuning must be performed.
*   Query performance must be optimized.
*   Cost optimization must be performed.

## Steps

1.  **Resource Optimization:**
    *   Identify resource bottlenecks in the observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager, APM Server, Jaeger).
    *   Adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory) for each component based on usage patterns.
    *   Implement horizontal scaling for components that require it.
2.  **Data Retention Tuning:**
    *   Analyze data retention policies for each component.
    *   Adjust retention periods based on data usage and storage capacity.
    *   Implement data aggregation and summarization techniques to reduce storage requirements.
3.  **Query Performance Optimization:**
    *   Identify slow-running queries in Prometheus and other data sources.
    *   Optimize query performance by improving indexing, query syntax, and data partitioning.
    *   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce query latency.
4.  **Cost Optimization:**
    *   Analyze the cost of running the observability stack.
    *   Identify areas where costs can be reduced (e.g., storage, compute).
    *   Implement cost-saving measures such as using spot instances, optimizing data storage, and reducing data transfer costs.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Resource optimization is performed.
*   Data retention tuning is performed.
*   Query performance is optimized.
*   Cost optimization is performed.

## Attempted Execution

1.  **Resource Optimization:**
    *   Attempted to start the Docker containers using `docker-compose up -d`.
    *   Encountered a DNS resolution error: `dial tcp: lookup docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com: no such host`.
    *   Unable to proceed with resource optimization due to the inability to start the containers.

## Checkpoints for Resuming Execution

Once the DNS resolution issue is resolved, the following checkpoints can be used to resume the execution of the plan:

1.  **Resource Optimization:**
    *   **Checkpoint:** After starting the Docker containers, use `docker stats` to identify resource bottlenecks in Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager, APM Server, and Jaeger.
    *   Adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory) for each component based on usage patterns.
    *   Implement horizontal scaling for components that require it.
2.  **Data Retention Tuning:**
    *   **Checkpoint:** After starting the Docker containers, analyze data retention policies for each component (Prometheus, Elasticsearch, etc.).
    *   Adjust retention periods based on data usage and storage capacity.
    *   Implement data aggregation and summarization techniques to reduce storage requirements.
3.  **Query Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Checkpoint:** After starting the Docker containers, identify slow-running queries in Prometheus and other data sources (Elasticsearch, SQL Server).
    *   Optimize query performance by improving indexing, query syntax, and data partitioning.
    *   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce query latency.
4.  **Cost Optimization:**
    *   **Checkpoint:** After starting the Docker containers, analyze the cost of running the observability stack (consider cloud provider costs, resource usage, etc.).
    *   Identify areas where costs can be reduced (e.g., storage, compute).
    *   Implement cost-saving measures such as using spot instances, optimizing data storage, and reducing data transfer costs.
