# UserService Observability: Data Flow and Traceability

This document explains the detailed data flow and traceability implementation in the UserService when an API call is processed, following the observability enhancements made according to the ComprehensiveObservabilityImplementation.md guide.

## Overview

When an API request lands on the UserService, it goes through a series of components that have been enhanced with observability features. These enhancements include:

1. Distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry and Jaeger
2. Structured logging with Serilog and Elasticsearch
3. Metrics collection with Prometheus
4. Correlation between logs, traces, and metrics using trace IDs

## Detailed Data Flow

### 1. Initial Request Processing

When an API request arrives at the UserService:

1. **API Gateway/Load Balancer** (external to our service)
   - Routes the request to an available UserService instance
   - May add initial tracing headers if configured

2. **Kestrel Web Server** (part of ASP.NET Core)
   - Receives the HTTP request
   - ASP.NET Core instrumentation automatically creates an initial activity/span

### 2. Middleware Processing

#### Authentication Middleware
- Checks for the presence of an Authorization header
- Creates an Activity span: `AuthenticationMiddleware.InvokeAsync`
- If authentication fails, returns a 401 response
- If successful, passes the request to the next middleware

#### Authorization Middleware
- Extracts the JWT token from the Authorization header
- Validates the token using the AuthenticationService
- Creates an Activity span: `AuthorizationMiddleware.InvokeAsync`
- If authorization fails, returns a 401 response
- If successful, passes the request to the controller

### 3. Controller Processing

#### AuthController
When a request reaches the AuthController (e.g., for login):

1. **Activity Span Creation**
   - Creates a new Activity span specific to the operation: `AuthController.Login`
   - Sets tags with relevant information (e.g., user email)
   - This span is automatically linked to the parent spans from middleware

2. **Trace ID Injection in Logs**
   - Calls `LoggingExtensions.AddTraceIdToLogContext()` to inject the current trace ID into Serilog's context
   - All subsequent log messages will automatically include the trace_id property

3. **Business Logic Execution**
   - Calls the AuthenticationService to authenticate the user
   - Creates a child Activity span: `AuthenticationService.Authenticate`
   - Within AuthenticationService, calls UserService to retrieve user data
   - Creates another child Activity span: `UserService.GetUserByUsername`

4. **Database Operation**
   - Entity Framework Core executes the database query
   - EF Core instrumentation creates spans for database operations
   - These spans are automatically linked to the parent UserService span

5. **Response Generation**
   - If authentication is successful, generates a JWT token
   - Creates Activity spans for token generation operations
   - Prepares the HTTP response

6. **Activity Span Completion**
   - Sets the status of the Activity span (Ok or Error)
   - Disposes the Activity, which sends the trace data to the OpenTelemetry Collector

### 4. Message Broker Processing

When the UserService publishes or consumes messages via MassTransit:

1. **Message Publishing**
   - When a service publishes an event (e.g., UserRegisteredEvent), MassTransit creates Activity spans
   - These spans are automatically linked to the parent operation that triggered the message
   - Trace context is propagated through message headers

2. **Message Consumption**
   - When a consumer processes a message, MassTransit creates Activity spans for the consumption
   - The consumer creates its own Activity spans for its operations
   - Trace context is extracted from message headers to maintain trace continuity

3. **MassTransit Instrumentation**
   - MassTransit is configured with OpenTelemetry instrumentation
   - ActivitySource with name "MassTransit" is added to the tracing configuration
   - Metrics are collected through the "MassTransit" Meter

### 5. Observability Data Collection

#### Tracing Data Flow
1. **Activity Creation**: Each component creates Activity spans using `ActivitySource`
2. **Span Enrichment**: Spans are enriched with relevant tags and attributes
3. **Automatic Instrumentation**: ASP.NET Core, HTTP Client, EF Core, and MassTransit instrumentation automatically create spans
4. **Data Export**: OpenTelemetry Collector exports trace data to Jaeger for storage and visualization

1. **API Gateway/Load Balancer** (external to our service)
   - Routes the request to an available UserService instance
   - May add initial tracing headers if configured

2. **Kestrel Web Server** (part of ASP.NET Core)
   - Receives the HTTP request
   - ASP.NET Core instrumentation automatically creates an initial activity/span

### 2. Middleware Processing

#### Authentication Middleware
- Checks for the presence of an Authorization header
- Creates an Activity span: `AuthenticationMiddleware.InvokeAsync`
- If authentication fails, returns a 401 response
- If successful, passes the request to the next middleware

#### Authorization Middleware
- Extracts the JWT token from the Authorization header
- Validates the token using the AuthenticationService
- Creates an Activity span: `AuthorizationMiddleware.InvokeAsync`
- If authorization fails, returns a 401 response
- If successful, passes the request to the controller

### 3. Controller Processing

#### AuthController
When a request reaches the AuthController (e.g., for login):

1. **Activity Span Creation**
   - Creates a new Activity span specific to the operation: `AuthController.Login`
   - Sets tags with relevant information (e.g., user email)
   - This span is automatically linked to the parent spans from middleware

2. **Trace ID Injection in Logs**
   - Calls `LoggingExtensions.AddTraceIdToLogContext()` to inject the current trace ID into Serilog's context
   - All subsequent log messages will automatically include the trace_id property

3. **Business Logic Execution**
   - Calls the AuthenticationService to authenticate the user
   - Creates a child Activity span: `AuthenticationService.Authenticate`
   - Within AuthenticationService, calls UserService to retrieve user data
   - Creates another child Activity span: `UserService.GetUserByUsername`

4. **Database Operation**

   - EF Core instrumentation creates spans for database operations
   - These spans are automatically linked to the parent UserService span

5. **Response Generation**
   - If authentication is successful, generates a JWT token
   - Creates Activity spans for token generation operations
   - Prepares the HTTP response

6. **Activity Span Completion**
   - Sets the status of the Activity span (Ok or Error)
   - Disposes the Activity, which sends the trace data to the OpenTelemetry Collector

### 4. Observability Data Collection

#### Tracing Data Flow
1. **Activity Creation**: Each component creates Activity spans using `ActivitySource`
2. **Span Enrichment**: Spans are enriched with relevant tags and attributes
3. **Automatic Instrumentation**: ASP.NET Core, HTTP Client, and EF Core instrumentation automatically create spans
4. **Data Export**: OpenTelemetry Collector exports trace data to Jaeger for storage and visualization

#### Logging Data Flow
1. **Structured Logging**: Serilog creates structured log events with properties
2. **Trace ID Injection**: `LoggingExtensions.AddTraceIdToLogContext()` injects trace IDs into log context
3. **Log Enrichment**: Logs are enriched with environment information (machine name, process ID, etc.)
4. **Data Export**: Serilog exports logs to Elasticsearch via the Elasticsearch sink

#### Metrics Data Flow
1. **Metric Collection**: Prometheus instrumentation collects metrics from ASP.NET Core and HTTP Client
2. **Data Export**: Metrics are exposed via the Prometheus endpoint and scraped by the Prometheus server

### 5. Data Correlation

All observability data (logs, traces, metrics) are correlated using the trace ID:

1. **Trace ID Generation**: Automatically generated by the Activity infrastructure
2. **Trace ID Propagation**: Automatically propagated through HTTP headers between services
3. **Trace ID Injection**: Manually injected into log context using `LoggingExtensions`
4. **Correlation in Storage**: All data systems (Jaeger, Elasticsearch, Prometheus) store data with trace ID references

## Example Flow: User Login

Let's trace through a concrete example of a user login request:

1. **HTTP Request**: `POST /auth/login` with username and password
2. **Kestrel**: Receives the request, ASP.NET Core instrumentation creates root span
3. **Authentication Middleware**: 
   - Creates span: `AuthenticationMiddleware.InvokeAsync`
   - Validates Authorization header presence
4. **Authorization Middleware**:
   - Creates span: `AuthorizationMiddleware.InvokeAsync`
   - Extracts and validates JWT token
5. **AuthController.Login**:
   - Creates span: `AuthController.Login`
   - Injects trace ID into log context
   - Logs: "Login requested for user {username}" with trace_id
6. **AuthenticationService.Authenticate**:
   - Creates span: `AuthenticationService.Authenticate`
   - Calls UserService.GetUserByUsername
7. **UserService.GetUserByUsername**:
   - Creates span: `UserService.GetUserByUsername`
   - EF Core executes database query
   - EF Core instrumentation creates span for SQL query
8. **Database**: SQL Server processes the query
9. **Response**: 
   - If successful, AuthenticationService generates JWT token
   - AuthController logs: "User {username} logged in successfully" with trace_id
   - Returns 200 OK with token
10. **Span Completion**: All spans are completed and exported to OpenTelemetry Collector
