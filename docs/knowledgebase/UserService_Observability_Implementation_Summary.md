## Observability Features Implemented

### 1. Distributed Tracing
- ActivitySource-based tracing for all critical operations
- Automatic instrumentation for ASP.NET Core, HTTP Client, and Entity Framework Core
- Manual spans for business-critical operations
- Jaeger exporter configuration for trace visualization
- Context propagation between services

### 2. Structured Logging
- Serilog configuration with Elasticsearch sink
- Trace ID injection in logs for correlation
- Environment enrichment (machine name, process ID, etc.)
- Structured log messages with contextual information
- Appropriate log levels for different scenarios

### 3. Metrics Collection
- Prometheus instrumentation for ASP.NET Core and HTTP Client
- Automatic metrics collection for system performance
- Configuration for Prometheus scraping

### 4. Data Correlation
- Trace ID consistency across logs, traces, and metrics
- Context propagation through HTTP headers
- MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) implementation for log correlation

## Benefits

1. **End-to-End Visibility**: Complete trace from HTTP request to database query
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Ability to identify slow operations at any level
3. **Error Diagnosis**: Correlated logs and traces for quick error identification
4. **Service Map**: Visualization of service dependencies and communication patterns
5. **Capacity Planning**: Metrics for understanding resource utilization
6. **Anomaly Detection**: Baseline performance metrics for detecting anomalies

## Tools and Technologies

1. **OpenTelemetry**: Provides the instrumentation framework
2. **Jaeger**: Stores and visualizes distributed traces
3. **Serilog**: Handles structured logging with Elasticsearch sink
4. **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes log data
5. **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics
6. **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics, logs, and traces in dashboards

This implementation provides comprehensive observability into the UserService operations, enabling better monitoring and debugging capabilities in production environments.
