# Modification Documentation: Authentication Enhancement

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to implement database context and enhance the authentication service to support full user management functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Context Implementation
- Added `ApplicationDbContext.cs` to provide Entity Framework Core database context
- Configured `User` entity with proper mappings and constraints
- Added necessary NuGet packages for Entity Framework Core and In-Memory database

### 2. UserService Implementation Updates
- Modified `UserService.cs` to use database context instead of dummy implementations
- Implemented all CRUD operations using Entity Framework Core
- Added proper dependency injection for `ApplicationDbContext`
- Ensured all methods properly interact with the database

### 3. Project Configuration Updates
- Added Entity Framework Core packages to `UserService.csproj`
- Updated constructor dependencies to include database context

### 4. Test Updates
- Modified `UserServiceTests.cs` to accommodate new constructor signature
- Updated test structure to work with database context

## Technical Details

### Database Context Configuration
The `ApplicationDbContext` provides:
- Proper mapping for the `User` entity
- Required property validations
- Unique index on email field
- Support for all User entity properties

### UserService Methods Implementation
- `GetUserByUsername`: Retrieves user by email from database
- `UpdatePassword`: Updates password hash and saves to database
- `GetUserById`: Retrieves user by ID from database  
- `CreateUser`: Creates new user in database
- `UpdateUser`: Updates existing user in database
- `DeleteUser`: Removes user from database

## Impact
These changes provide a complete database-backed user management system that aligns with the entity model specification and API requirements. The implementation follows best practices for dependency injection and database operations.

## Validation
All changes have been compiled successfully with no errors. Tests pass with expected behavior for the core functionality.
