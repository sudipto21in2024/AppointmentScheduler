# Filebeat Configuration Notes

This file is a placeholder for Filebeat configuration. 
You need to configure Filebeat on the application side to ship logs to Logstash.

**Configuration Steps:**

1.  **Install Filebeat:** Install Filebeat on the application server or container.
2.  **Configure Filebeat Input:** Configure Filebeat to read logs from the appropriate log files.
3.  **Configure Logstash Output:** Configure Filebeat to send logs to Logstash on port 5044 (as defined in docker-compose.yml).
4.  **Enable and Start Filebeat:** Enable and start the Filebeat service.

**Example Filebeat Configuration (filebeat.yml):**

```yaml
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  paths:
    - /path/to/your/application/logs/*.log

output.logstash:
  hosts: ["logstash:5044"]
```

**Technical Notes:**

*   Replace `/path/to/your/application/logs/*.log` with the actual path to your application log files.
*   Ensure that the `logstash:5044` host is resolvable from the Filebeat instance (e.g., within the same Docker network).
*   Consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration values.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Secure the communication between Filebeat and Logstash using TLS.
*   Implement access control for Filebeat configuration files.
