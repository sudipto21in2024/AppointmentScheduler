# Performance Baselines Setup

This file provides notes on how to set up performance baselines in Elastic APM.

**Performance Baselines:**

Performance baselines are a historical record of your application's performance. They help you identify performance regressions and anomalies.

**Configuration Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Application Instrumentation is Enabled:**
    *   Performance baselines rely on data collected by the APM agents. Make sure the application instrumentation is properly configured (see `apm/application-instrumentation.txt`).
2.  **Allow APM Server to Collect Data:**
    *   Let the APM Server collect data for a period of time (e.g., 1-2 weeks) to establish a baseline.
3.  **Define Baseline Metrics:**
    *   Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that you want to track (e.g., response time, transaction duration, error rate).
4.  **Create Baseline Alerts:**
    *   Create alerts in Kibana to notify you when performance metrics deviate significantly from the established baseline.
    *   Use the anomaly detection features in Elastic to automatically detect performance regressions.

**Technical Notes:**

*   The accuracy of the performance baselines depends on the quality and consistency of the collected APM data.
*   Regularly review and adjust the baselines to account for changes in application behavior and traffic patterns.
*   Consider using machine learning to automatically detect anomalies and adjust the baselines dynamically.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Implement access control for the APM Server UI and Kibana to prevent unauthorized access to performance baseline data.
