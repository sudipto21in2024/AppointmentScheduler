# Service Maps Setup

This file provides notes on how to set up service maps in Elastic APM.

**Service Maps:**

Service maps are a visual representation of the dependencies between services in your application. They help you understand the flow of requests and identify performance bottlenecks.

**Configuration Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Application Instrumentation is Enabled:**
    *   Service maps rely on data collected by the APM agents. Make sure the application instrumentation is properly configured (see `apm/application-instrumentation.txt`).
2.  **Verify Data is Being Collected:**
    *   Check the APM Server UI to ensure that data is being collected from your services.
3.  **Service Map Generation:**
    *   APM Server automatically generates service maps based on the collected data. There is usually no additional configuration required.
4.  **Access Service Maps:**
    *   Navigate to the Service Maps section in the APM Server UI.
    *   Select a service to view its dependencies and the overall service map.

**Technical Notes:**

*   Service maps are automatically generated based on the relationships observed in the collected trace data.
*   The quality of the service map depends on the completeness and accuracy of the application instrumentation.
*   Ensure that context propagation is properly configured to accurately track requests across services.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Implement access control for the APM Server UI to prevent unauthorized access to service map data.
