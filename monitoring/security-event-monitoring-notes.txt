# Security Event Monitoring

This file provides notes on how to implement security event monitoring.

**Security Event Monitoring:**

Security event monitoring involves collecting, analyzing, and alerting on security-related events in your application and infrastructure.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Identify Security Events:**
    *   Identify the events that need to be monitored.
    *   Examples:
        *   Authentication failures
        *   Authorization failures
        *   Suspicious activity
        *   Configuration changes
        *   Malware detection
        *   System errors that may indicate a security issue
        *   Network intrusion attempts
        *   Data exfiltration attempts
2.  **Configure Systems to Generate Security Events:**
    *   Configure your systems to generate security events in a consistent format.
    *   Use appropriate logging levels and event IDs.
    *   Consider using the Common Event Format (CEF) or the Extended Event Format (EEF) for audit logs.
3.  **Collect Security Events:**
    *   Use Filebeat or other log shippers to collect the security events and send them to Elasticsearch.
    *   Configure Filebeat to read security logs from various sources, such as system logs, application logs, and security devices.
    * Implement data enrichment by using geoip or threat intelligence data sources
4.  **Analyze Security Events:**
    *   Use Logstash to parse and enrich the security events.
    *   Create Grok filters or other appropriate filters to extract relevant information from the events.
    *   Normalize the security event data to a common format.
    *   Use regular expressions and other techniques to extract relevant information from the audit logs.
5.  **Create Security Dashboards:**
    *   Use Kibana to create dashboards to visualize security events.
    *   Create visualizations to track key security metrics, such as the number of authentication failures, the number of suspicious events, and the number of configuration changes.
    *   Use pre-built security dashboards or create your own custom dashboards.
    * Use visualization types like Maps, GeoIP to represent geographical security events
6.  **Alert on Security Events:**
    *   Configure Alertmanager to send notifications when security events occur.
    *   Use appropriate alert thresholds to avoid false positives.
    *   Integrate Alertmanager with a ticketing system or other incident management tool.

**Technical Notes:**

*   Use a consistent format for security events across all systems.
*   Ensure that security events are properly correlated with other monitoring data, such as metrics and traces.
*   Regularly review and update the security event monitoring configuration to account for new threats and vulnerabilities.
*   Automate the security event monitoring process as much as possible.
*   Use machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and suspicious activity.
* Implement correlation rules.
*   Implement anomaly detection.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Secure the security event monitoring system to prevent unauthorized access to security event data.
*   Implement access control for the monitoring systems to prevent unauthorized access to security event data.
*   Ensure that security events do not contain sensitive information.
*   Implement audit log retention and archival strategy.
*   Encrypt security event data at rest and in transit.
*   Implement regular security audits of the security event monitoring system.
*   Ensure that SIEM solution is hardened and protected.

**Compliance Considerations:**

*   HIPAA
*   PCI DSS
*   SOC2
