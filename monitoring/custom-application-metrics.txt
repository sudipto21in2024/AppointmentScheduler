# Custom Application Metrics

This file provides notes on how to create custom application metrics.

**Custom Application Metrics:**

Custom application metrics are metrics that are specific to your application and provide insights into its unique behavior.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Identify Key Metrics:**
    *   Identify the key metrics that are important to your application and your business.
    *   Examples:
        *   Number of new users
        *   Number of active users
        *   Transaction volume
        *   Order value
2.  **Instrument Application Code:**
    *   Instrument your application code to collect the custom metrics.
    *   Use a Prometheus client library or other appropriate tool to collect and expose the metrics.
3.  **Define Prometheus Metrics:**
    *   Define the custom metrics in Prometheus.
    *   Use appropriate metric types (e.g., Counter, Gauge, Histogram).
4.  **Configure Prometheus to Scrape Metrics:**
    *   Configure Prometheus to scrape the custom metrics from your application.
    *   Add a new scrape job to the `prometheus.yml` file.
5.  **Create Grafana Dashboards:**
    *   Create Grafana dashboards to visualize the custom metrics.
    *   Use appropriate visualizations (e.g., graphs, tables, single stat panels) to display the metrics.

**Example Implementation (Java):**

```java
import io.prometheus.client.Counter;

public class MyAppMetrics {

    static final Counter newUsers = Counter.build()
            .name("new_users_total")
            .help("Total number of new users.")
            .labelNames("trace_id")
            .register();

    public static void recordNewUser() {
        newUsers.inc();
    }
}
```

**Technical Notes:**

*   Choose metric names that are descriptive and consistent.
*   Use labels to add context to the metrics (e.g., service name, environment).
*   Regularly review and adjust the custom metrics to ensure they are still relevant and providing valuable insights.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Ensure that custom metric data does not contain sensitive information.
*   Implement access control for Prometheus and Grafana to prevent unauthorized access to metric data.
