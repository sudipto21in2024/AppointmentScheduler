# SLI/SLO Definitions

This file provides notes on how to define Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

**SLI (Service Level Indicator):**

*   A quantitative measure of a particular aspect of service performance.
*   Examples:
    *   Request latency
    *   Error rate
    *   Availability
    *   Throughput

**SLO (Service Level Objective):**

*   A target level of performance for a particular SLI.
*   Examples:
    *   99.9% of requests should have a latency of less than 200ms.
    *   The service should have an availability of 99.99%.
    *   The error rate should be less than 0.1%.

**Configuration Steps:**

1.  **Define SLIs:**
    *   Identify the key metrics that are important to your business and your users.
    *   Choose metrics that are measurable and actionable.
2.  **Set SLOs:**
    *   Set SLOs for each SLI.
    *   Base SLOs on user expectations, business requirements, and historical performance data.
    *   Make SLOs realistic and achievable.
3.  **Monitor SLIs and SLOs:**
    *   Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor SLIs and SLOs.
    *   Create dashboards to visualize SLI performance and SLO compliance.
4.  **Alert on SLO Violations:**
    *   Configure Alertmanager to send notifications when SLOs are violated.
    *   Use appropriate alert thresholds to avoid false positives.

**Example SLI/SLO Definitions:**

*   **SLI:** Request latency
    *   **SLO:** 99% of requests should have a latency of less than 100ms.
*   **SLI:** Error rate
    *   **SLO:** The service should have an error rate of less than 0.01%.
*   **SLI:** Availability
    *   **SLO:** The service should be available 99.99% of the time.

**Technical Notes:**

*   SLIs and SLOs should be aligned with business goals.
*   Regularly review and adjust SLIs and SLOs to account for changes in application behavior and business requirements.
*   Use SLOs to drive engineering decisions and prioritize work.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Ensure that SLI and SLO data does not contain sensitive information.
*   Implement access control for monitoring systems to prevent unauthorized access to SLI/SLO data.
