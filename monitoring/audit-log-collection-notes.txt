# Audit Log Collection

This file provides notes on how to implement audit log collection.

**Audit Logging:**

Audit logging involves collecting and storing logs of user activity and system events for security and compliance purposes.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Identify Audit Events:**
    *   Identify the events that need to be audited.
    *   Examples:
        *   User login and logout
        *   Data access and modification
        *   Configuration changes
        *   Security-related events
        *   Privilege escalations
        *   Access control changes
2.  **Configure Systems to Generate Audit Logs:**
    *   Configure your systems to generate audit logs in a consistent format.
    *   Use appropriate logging levels and event IDs.
    *   Consider using the Common Event Format (CEF) or the Extended Event Format (EEF) for audit logs.
3.  **Collect Audit Logs:**
    *   Use Filebeat or other log shippers to collect the audit logs and send them to Elasticsearch.
    *   Configure Filebeat to read audit logs from various sources, such as system logs, application logs, and security devices.
    *   Configure Filebeat to forward logs to Logstash.
4.  **Analyze Audit Logs:**
    *   Use Logstash to parse and enrich the audit logs.
    *   Create Grok filters or other appropriate filters to extract relevant information from the logs.
    *   Normalize the audit log data to a common format.
    *   Use regular expressions and other techniques to extract relevant information from the audit logs.
    *   Store data in JSON format to allow for easy parsing.
5.  **Secure Audit Logs:**
    *   Ensure that audit logs are tamper-proof and cannot be modified or deleted by unauthorized users.
    *   Store audit logs in a secure location.
    *   Implement write-once-read-many (WORM) storage for audit logs.
    *   Implement log rotation and archival.
    *   Regularly test and verify log integrity.
    *   Use digital signatures to verify log authenticity and integrity.
    *   Implement SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to correlate logs and events

**Technical Notes:**

*   Use a consistent format for audit logs across all systems.
*   Ensure that audit logs are properly correlated with other monitoring data, such as metrics and traces.
*   Regularly review and update the audit logging configuration to account for new security threats and compliance requirements.
*   Automate the audit logging process as much as possible.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Implement strong access control for audit logs to prevent unauthorized access.
*   Use encryption to protect audit logs from unauthorized disclosure.
*   Implement data retention policies to ensure that audit logs are stored for an appropriate period of time.
*   Ensure that access to audit logs is audited.
* Implement alerting for suspicious activity in audit logs

**Compliance Considerations:**

*   HIPAA
*   PCI DSS
*   SOC2
