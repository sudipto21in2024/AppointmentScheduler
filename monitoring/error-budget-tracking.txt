# Error Budget Tracking

This file provides notes on how to implement error budget tracking.

**Error Budget:**

*   The amount of time a service is allowed to be unavailable or perform poorly before it impacts the business.
*   Based on SLOs (Service Level Objectives).

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Define SLOs:**
    *   Define SLOs for your services (see `monitoring/sli-slo-definitions.txt`).
    *   SLOs should be based on user expectations and business requirements.
2.  **Calculate Error Budget:**
    *   Calculate the error budget based on the SLO.
    *   Example: If the SLO is 99.9% availability, the error budget is 0.1% of the time.
3.  **Track Error Budget Consumption:**
    *   Monitor the service and track how much of the error budget has been consumed.
    *   Use metrics to track errors, downtime, and other performance issues.
4.  **Alert on Error Budget Depletion:**
    *   Configure Alertmanager to send notifications when the error budget is nearing depletion.
    *   Use appropriate alert thresholds to avoid false positives.

**Example Calculation:**

*   **SLO:** 99.9% availability
*   **Error Budget:** 0.1%
*   **Time Period:** 30 days
*   **Total Time:** 30 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 43200 minutes
*   **Error Budget (Minutes):** 43200 minutes * 0.001 = 43.2 minutes

**Technical Notes:**

*   Use a consistent time period for calculating the error budget (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
*   Regularly review and adjust the SLOs and error budgets to account for changes in application behavior and business requirements.
*   Use error budget depletion as a trigger for process improvements and architectural changes.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Ensure that error budget data does not contain sensitive information.
*   Implement access control for monitoring systems to prevent unauthorized access to error budget data.
