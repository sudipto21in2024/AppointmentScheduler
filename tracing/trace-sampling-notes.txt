# Trace Sampling Strategies

This file provides notes on how to implement trace sampling strategies in the application.

**Trace Sampling:**

Trace sampling is a technique used to reduce the volume of trace data collected by distributed tracing systems. It involves selectively collecting traces based on certain criteria.

**Sampling Strategies:**

1.  **Head-Based Sampling:** The sampling decision is made at the beginning of the trace, at the root service. This decision is then propagated to all downstream services.
    *   **Probability Sampling:** Sample a fixed percentage of traces (e.g., 10%).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of traces per second.
2.  **Tail-Based Sampling:** The sampling decision is made after the trace has completed, allowing for more informed decisions based on the entire trace data.
    *   **Error-Based Sampling:** Sample traces that contain errors or exceptions.
    *   **Latency-Based Sampling:** Sample traces that exceed a certain latency threshold.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Implement sampling in the application code using the OpenTelemetry SDK.
*   Configure the sampling ratio or rate based on the desired balance between trace data volume and observability.
*   Consider using adaptive sampling techniques to dynamically adjust the sampling rate based on system load or error rates.
*   Ensure that the sampling decision is propagated across services using context propagation.

**Example OpenTelemetry Configuration (Java):**

```java
SdkTracerProviderBuilder tracerProviderBuilder = SdkTracerProvider.builder()
    .setSampler(SamplingDecision.probability(0.1)); // Sample 10% of traces
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   Ensure that sampling decisions are not based on sensitive data.
*   Protect the sampling configuration from unauthorized modification.
