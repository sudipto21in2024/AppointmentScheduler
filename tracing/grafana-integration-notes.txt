# Grafana Integration for Distributed Tracing

This file provides notes on how to integrate Grafana with Jaeger to visualize trace data.

**Integration Steps:**

1.  **Add Jaeger Data Source:** Add Jaeger as a data source in Grafana.
    *   Navigate to Grafana -> Configuration -> Data Sources.
    *   Click "Add data source" and select "Jaeger".
    *   Configure the Jaeger data source with the following settings:
        *   **Name:** Jaeger
        *   **Type:** Jaeger
        *   **URL:** http://jaeger:16686  (or the appropriate URL for your Jaeger instance)
        *   **Access:** proxy
        *   **Other settings:** Use default values.
    *   Click "Save & Test" to verify the connection.
2.  **Import Jaeger Dashboards (Optional):** Import pre-built Jaeger dashboards into Grafana.
    *   Jaeger provides pre-built dashboards that can be imported into Grafana for visualizing trace data.
    *   Download the dashboard JSON files from the Jaeger repository or community resources.
    *   Navigate to Grafana -> Dashboards -> Import.
    *   Upload the dashboard JSON file and configure the data source to "Jaeger".
3.  **Explore Traces:** Use Grafana's Explore feature to query and visualize traces from Jaeger.
    *   Navigate to Grafana -> Explore.
    *   Select the "Jaeger" data source.
    *   Use the Jaeger query language to search for traces based on service name, operation name, tags, or other criteria.
    *   Visualize the traces in the trace view.

**Technical Notes:**

*   Ensure that the Jaeger URL is resolvable from the Grafana instance (e.g., within the same Docker network).
*   Consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration values.
*   Explore the Jaeger query language to create custom queries and visualizations.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Secure the communication between Grafana and Jaeger using TLS.
*   Implement access control for Grafana dashboards and data sources.
