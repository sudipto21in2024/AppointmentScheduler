# Frontend Implementation Guidance

This document provides implementation guidance for the frontend components of the Multi-Tenant Appointment Booking System.

## Overview

The frontend implementation follows a component-based architecture using Angular with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling. The implementation is organized into logical modules that correspond to the main functional areas of the application.

## Component Structure

### Authentication Components (FE-003-01)
- **Login Component**: Handles user authentication
- **Registration Component**: Manages new user registration
- **Password Reset Component**: Facilitates password recovery

### Service Management Components (FE-003-02)
- **Service List Component**: Displays available services with filtering
- **Service Create Component**: Enables service providers to create new services
- **Service Edit Component**: Allows modification of existing services
- **Service Card Component**: Presents service information in a card format

### Booking Management Components (FE-003-03)
- **Booking List Component**: Shows user bookings with status filtering
- **Booking Create Component**: Facilitates new booking creation
- **Booking Details Component**: Displays detailed booking information
- **Slot Selector Component**: Enables time slot selection for bookings

### Payment Components (FE-03-04)
- **Payment Form Component**: Handles secure payment processing
- **Payment History Component**: Shows transaction history
- **Payment Status Component**: Displays current payment status

### Notification Components (FE-003-05)
- **Notification List Component**: Displays user notifications
- **Notification Detail Component**: Shows detailed notification information
- **Notification Preferences Component**: Manages notification settings

## API Integration

All components integrate with backend services through dedicated Angular services that handle HTTP requests. Each service corresponds to a backend module:

- **Auth Service**: Handles authentication API calls
- **Service Service**: Manages service-related API interactions
- **Booking Service**: Handles booking and slot API calls
- **Payment Service**: Manages payment processing APIs
- **Notification Service**: Handles notification API interactions

## Design System

The implementation follows a consistent design system with:

- **Design Tokens**: Consistent colors, typography, and spacing
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive layouts
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## State Management

State management is handled through:

- **Component State**: Local state within individual components
- **Service State**: Shared state managed by Angular services
- **Route Parameters**: State passed through URL parameters
- **Browser Storage**: Persistent state using localStorage/sessionStorage when appropriate

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens stored securely
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for routes and actions
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive information handling
- **CORS**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing configuration

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Component and service testing with Jasmine/Karma
- **Integration Tests**: API integration testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: User journey testing with Cypress
- **Accessibility Tests**: Automated accessibility compliance checking

## Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Route-based lazy loading for code splitting
- **Caching**: HTTP caching for static resources
- **Bundle Optimization**: Minification and tree-shaking
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images and lazy loading

## Deployment

- **Build Process**: Angular CLI production builds
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific configuration files
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Error tracking and performance monitoring

This guidance document serves as a reference for implementing the frontend components according to the defined architecture and best practices.
